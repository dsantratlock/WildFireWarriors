# WildFireWarriors

### Main Idea:
Make a wildfire tracker that can show where wildfires are in the world based on previous data and reports sent in by people. 
Each report will mark a place on a map that indicates where a fire most likely is. 
If there are enough reports in close proximity to each other, those markers will connect to form a polygon to show the approx area of the wildfire.
