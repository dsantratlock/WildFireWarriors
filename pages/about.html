    <p class="about_content">
        Wildfires have been growing in severity with the changes in climate. Millions of people are affected by them every year.
        One of the main problems with fighting wildfires is early detection. Right now, we often don't know about a new wildfire
        until 3-4 hours after it has started, which is plenty of time for a wildfire to get out of hand. We need more eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        The people who care most about the spread of wildfires are the people who live in the danger zone. Wouldn't it be great if
        they could contribute to their own protection? If they could be warriors in the fight to save their homes and livelihoods?
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        We propose an app in two parts. Wildfire Warriors would be a crowd sourced fire spotting app that alerts authorities and fellow
        users of a new fire before it gets out of control, as well as informing people about the dangers posed by a wildfire in their area.
        This would be a progressive web app that users, AKA warriors, could install on their phones but also access online.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        The first part of the app, fire spotting, would be crucial. Say a hiker in the woods notices a fire. Using the Wildfire Warriors
        app, they could Report the Fire, which is to say, they could take a picture or five second video of the fire, mark where they are
        on the app's map and the time they saw it, as well as any weather or terrain in the area that might be important to the fire they've
        witnessed.  Even if they have no signal, data, or wifi when they see the fire, a phone can still grab a GPS location.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        After that, the information from the report would be sent to the local fire station or 9-1-1 operatives, who will review the five-second
        video and determine its validity. Additionally, the report would show up on the Wildfire Warriors map with a small radius around it.
        As more reports of the fire come in and more points are plotted on the map, a polygon forms that is color coded to the danger level of the fire.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        Our app's map would be connected to local weather reports, specifically wind speed and direction. Wind is a huge uncontrollable factor
        in the spread of wildfires, and it also dictates the distribution of smoke. Since smoke is detrimental to visibility and air quality,
        and covers a much bigger area, it is just as big of a concern as the fire itself. Using this data, the app would have separate polygons
        for the fire’s area, smoke distribution and thickness, and the prediction of where the fire and smoke will progress to.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        The second part of the Wildfire Warriors app would be informational. This includes notifying warriors that they are in an affected area;
        evacuation areas, shelters, and routes with road closures updated; a checklist for preparing for a wildfire; the difference between a fire
        watch and a fire warning; and the level of fire danger at a particular time. The app would be able to connect to various social media
        accounts, so that warriors can mark themselves safe for their family and friends to see. In addition to receiving notifications about
        his or her own area, a warrior could choose to get notified about multiple areas so they could reach family members who might be affected
        by a wildfire.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content">
        The Wildfire Warriors app would empower people to take charge of their own safety when it comes to wildfires. It would inform them of how to prepare for a wildfire, and when to be concerned about one in their area.  And most importantly, it would inform authorities about impending wildfires faster than our current warning systems.
